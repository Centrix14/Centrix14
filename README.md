### Hi there 😃
I'm Artyom a 18 yo programmer (C, Common Lisp) and IT researcher (i haven't any scientific regalia, i'm not a scientist).

🔨 Currently i work over ELI — an interpreter of one of the my experemental programming languages.

🔭 I'm interested in various areas of IT:
- Progremming languages design
- Functional programming
- Formal verification
- Fundamentals of IT

😔 But, since i became a student, i haven't much time to study new things. For example: formal verification. I think, that is a very interesting area, unfortunately my knowleges of it, honestly speaking, insufficient. However, i endeavour, and fog of incomprehension, that exists in my head, soon will dissipate.

📖 Currently i learning functional and genetic programming.

In real life. except programming i interested in poetery ✨ and phylosophy ☂️.
